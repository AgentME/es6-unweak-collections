ES6 Harmony Collections
===========================================


The aim of this repository is to provide an **unobtrusive, performances oriented** shim for ES6 collections such **Map** and **Set** for node.js and Browserify.

Collections using weak references such as **WeakMap** are not present as they can't always be efficiently or correctly implemented without native support.

These global functions are already available in Firefox Nightly and Chrome Dev channel through *Enable Experimental JavaScript* in *chrome://flags/* section.


Features
--------
  * compatible with **node.js**, and both **all browsers** and **Rhino** through Browserify (`npm install es6-unweak-collections`).
  * If native collections are present, they're returned instead rather than the shims.
  * **size and performances oriented** polyfill.


Alternatives
------------
  * The original [es6-collections](https://github.com/WebReflection/es6-collections) project that this is based on.
  * the bigger and rich in dependencies [WeakMap shim from Mark S. Miller](http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/source/browse/trunk/src/ses/WeakMap.js), the best attempt to avoid undesired memory leaks. Bear in mind some leak is still possible plus *Object* natives are wrapped plus it brings WeakMap only
  * the unfortunately and so far slower and heavier, memory usage speaking, alternative from [Benvie Harmony Collections Shim](https://github.com/Benvie/ES6-Harmony-Collections-Shim)
  * differently implemented Map and Set (no WeakMap) from [Paul Millr](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim), together with few others ES6 prototypes
  * another attempt based on valueOf to avoid IE enumerability, still problematic with *unknown* objects but less leaks prone from [Gozala](https://gist.github.com/1269991)
